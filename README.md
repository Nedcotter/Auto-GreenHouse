# Automated-GreenHouse
Arduino and Raspberry Pi based Automated GreenHouse for VCE course with SQL server for displaying database on website.

As i assume some of you may be from my same school where the teachers often use the same course material anually, i will provide instructions on electrical diagrams and schematics and required arduino components.

Any issues contact me on discord at: M0rtem#6969 or you can probably find my email on my profile

##### NOTE:
* Many of the components are optional, for example you can remove the serial code if you don't want to upload your data to a raspberry pi or webserver
* This repo doesnt contain the .dxf and .f3d files for the gears used for the lid nor does it contain any information on the box design, purely the electronics and software

## Requirements:
* Raspberry Pi 4 - Optional but recomended
* Arduino Uno
* Arduino Relay Board
* DHT11 - Temperature and humidity Sensor
* Rain Sensor
* DC Pump
* 28BYJ Stepper Motor
* Jumper leads
* bread board - optional
* Solder & Soldering Iron
* Soil moisture Sensor - Simple DIY one used here

## Wiring Schematics

will be updated eventually...
