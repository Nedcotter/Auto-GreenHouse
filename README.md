# Automated-GreenHouse
Arduino and Raspberry Pi based Automated GreenHouse for VCE course with SQL server for displaying database on website

As i assume some of you may be from my same school where the teachers use the same course material anually i will provide instructions on electrical diagrams and scematics and required arduino components

##### NOTE:
* Many of the components are optional, for example you can remove the serial code if you don't want to upload your data to a raspberry pi or webserver
* This repo doesnt contain the .dxf and .f3d files for the gears used for the lid nor does it contain any information on the box design, purely the electronics and software
